Deployment of containerized Application with Kubernetes


I am going to talk about how you can deploy Docker containers with Kubernetes.

In case you want to prepare for the talk you can checkout the tutorial about minikube(https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
This will explain how you can set up a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.
Installing minikube is not required for the presentation.

You can find all the material, slides, sources etc on my GitHub:
https://github.com/qvalentin/k8sTalk
To view the slides you will need Jupyter Notebooks or simply open the Pr√§sentation.slides.html document.

The example code can be found here:
https://github.com/FileFighter/k8sDeployment


As a workwork I want you to think about the following questions related to your SE project:
Are you using Docker? If not, why?
Are you using a microservice architecture?
What parts of your application are scalable?
How could you deploy your application with Kubernetes?

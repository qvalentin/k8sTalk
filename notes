I am going to talk about how you can deploy Docker containers with Kubernetes.
You can find all the material, slides, sources etc on my GitHub:
https://github.com/qvalentin/k8sTalk
To view the slides in your browser, you need Jupyter Notebooks or open the Pr√§sentation.slides.html document.


The example code can be found here:
